# Theme.Bootswatch Orchard CMS Theme

---

> This is a clone of Theme.Bootswatch to update to the newest Bootstrap and Bootswatch. The less file structure are heavily changed since from Orchard 1.9.3, it uses gulpfile.js to transpile the .css/.js file.
> I also use bower to download the components (Pls see source/bower.json) and try to have minimum change to .less from the components.


## Features

- Requires Orchard 1.8 or higher
- Bootstrap 3.3.7
- Font Awesome 4.6.3
- Bootswatch 3.x templates
- RTL support
- Admin panel selectable options

## RTL Support
To automatically flip placements from right to left and vice versa (in bilingual pages), use `.flip` alongside `.pull-right` and `.pull-left`. This is a custom class and is not available in the original Bootstrap 3.
